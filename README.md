# Griffin Jax

Jax + Flax implementation of the ["Griffin: Mixing Gated Linear Recurrences with Local Attention for Efficient Language Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427). 

A hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention.

### Key Information About Architecture

- Griffin-3B outperforms Mamba-3B, and Griffin-7B and Griffin-14B achieve performance competitive with Llama-2, despite being trained on nearly 7 times fewer tokens.
- Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training.

### TODOs:

[] Usage and training code will be added to the repository.
